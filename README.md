# RSA and Caesar Cipher Encryption and Decryption   
## Introduction   
### Caesar Cipher   
Caesar Cipher is a classic encryption technique named after Julius Caesar, who reportedly used it to secure his communication between his army. It is a substitution cipher where each text in a plain text is shifted by a pre-define amount. Due to its simplicity, it is easily broken by bruteforcing, since there are only 26 alphabet in the English alphabet system.
