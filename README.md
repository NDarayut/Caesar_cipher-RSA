# RSA and Caesar Cipher Encryption and Decryption   
## Introduction   
### Caesar Cipher   
Caesar Cipher is a classic encryption technique named after Julius Caesar, who reportedly used it to secure his communication between his army. It is a substitution cipher where each text in a plain text is shifted by a pre-define amount. Due to its simplicity, it is easily broken by bruteforcing, since there are only 26 alphabet in the English alphabet system.   
### RSA   
RSA is a powerful encryption algorithm widely used in secure data transmission. Unlike the Caesar Cipher, RSA is a public-key cryptosystem that relies on the computational difficulty of factoring large prime numbers. It provides strong security and is a cornerstone of modern encryption, used in everything from secure websites to digital signatures.   
## How to set up   
Create a virtual environment: ```python -m venv <your-env-name>```
